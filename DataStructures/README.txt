Structures:
  - Binary Tree
        -> Tree structure where each leaf-node has a maximum of two child nodes

  - Linked List
        -> List where each node has a reference to the next node in the list

  - Double Linked List
        -> List where each node has a reference to the previous and next node in the list

  - Hash Table
        -> Table of key-value pairs, where each key is hashed
